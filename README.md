# Resell-Landing-Page-Project

This is a working project using only HTML and CSS to create a landing page for reselling items. 

### The page has the following:

  -header with the company name and logo and a button to sign in or view a cart.
  
  -navigation with links to sections within the page
  
  -featured items banner
  
  -main section of items with full descriptions, feature lists, options, etc for each item.
  
  
### Current Issues

The featured items banner is contained within the main section. The main section does not implement any feature lists or options, and there is no input / buttons /dropdowns to add the items to the cart.
